                        <h3>Movie Mania</h3>
                        <p>
                            Developed as part of a capstone course at Rowan University, the MovieMania Project is a web application that enables users to create a personal library for adding movies to a "Watch Later" list. It also allows users to catalog and store watched movies for future reference and provides movie recommendations based on their "Watch Later" list.
                            The project is built using HTML, JavaScript, and JSONbin.io, with the TMDB API utilized for fetching movie details and recommendations. As the backend developer, I was responsible for implementing data storage and API integration. The project was a collaborative effort, with contributions from David Ranoia, Eric Robinson, Haley Marvasi, and Nick Ciquero.

                        <h3>Spotify Top 20 Track Analyzer</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Spotify Top 20 Tracks Analyzer is a Python-based application designed to interact with the Spotify API, allowing users to retrieve and analyze data on the top 20 tracks within a user-specified genre. The application uses the Spotipy library to access Spotifyâ€™s data and extract essential details about each track, such as track names, popularity scores, and external URLs.

To visualize this data, the project employs Matplotlib, creating interactive bar graphs that display the popularity scores of the top 20 tracks. These bar graphs feature clickable elements, enabling users to open and explore individual tracks directly on Spotify.

The user interface is crafted with Tkinter, offering a user-friendly graphical interface that includes dropdown menus and buttons for genre selection and data viewing. This GUI enhances the overall usability of the application, making it easy for users to interact with and explore their favorite music genres.
